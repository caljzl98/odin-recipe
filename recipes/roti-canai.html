        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine bread flour, sugar, kosher salt, egg, melted 
                butter, and water for roti canai in a mixing bowl. Mix 
                with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a 
                work surface and knead until a smooth, elastic dough 
                forms, about 7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide dough into 8 equal pieces and form each one into a 
                ball. Coat each ball with vegetable oil, transfer to a 
                plate, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 8 
                hours, to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter for dip in a saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                Add onion, ginger, garlic, kosher salt, curry powder, 
                paprika, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir 
                together and saute until onion has softened and spices are 
                fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and cook 
                until it starts to toast and caramelize on the bottom of 
                the pan, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in cold water and coconut milk. Add lentils; stir and 
                bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, 
                stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. 
                Taste and adjust seasonings. Reduce heat to low and keep 
                warm while you prepare the roti canai.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place 1/4 cup melted butter in a bowl. Transfer rested 
                dough balls onto a lightly oiled work surface. Flatten 
                each ball slightly and rub a little melted butter on top. 
                Cover dough with plastic wrap and let it warm up slightly, 
                about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press on top of the plastic wrap to flatten warmed dough. 
                Remove plastic wrap and add a bit more butter. Stretch 
                each piece from the center out to get it as thin as 
                possible (until almost see-through), adding more butter as 
                needed. Don't worry if there are a few small tears.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle on more melted butter, then pull two sides in 
                towards the center until touching and overlapping 
                slightly. Pull the other two edges in the same way to form 
                a square. Cover with plastic wrap and flatten roti canai 
                one more time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add some melted butter to a skillet set over medium or 
                medium-low heat. Add roti canai and cook until browned, 
                flaky, and crispy on the outside and fully cooked through 
                on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the skillet and smush it with your hands to 
                fluff it up and separate the layers of dough. Repeat to 
                cook remaining roti canai.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the curried red lentil dip with cilantro and 
                sliced serrano peppers and serve alongside the 
                roti canai.
            </li>
        </ol>
